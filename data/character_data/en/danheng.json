This body belongs to him. It belongs to this current name.<br /><br />When he arrives at the port, the escorting soldier removes the last of his shackles. He walks forward without looking back. He can feel, ever so faintly, several pairs of eyes gazing at him from within the city. Eyes filled with hatred.<br /><br />It isn't until the spaceship takes off that he turns his head and takes one final look at this place. It really is a magnificent and grand spaceship — just like the books say.<br /><br />He only glances at it once, then turns his head away to where the stars shimmer dimly and an uncertain future lies.<br /><br />He looks out in silence.",

He has to be careful.<br /><br />But he still can't shake off the man with the beastly eyes.<br /><br />If others in his homeworld felt hatred toward him, then that man only has a killing intent toward him — even the spaceships he had traveled on were all annihilated.

However, he stayed up all night reading the data bank. At some point, he'd drifted off to sleep.<br /><br />He opened the door to find the conductor standing there, reprimanding him for staying up late — Otherwise he'd miss out on a piping hot breakfast and would've wasted the care put into it. He nods and the conductor quietens down in satisfaction, wobbling as they lead him into the passenger car.<br /><br />The redhead woman — who he now knows is named Himeko — flashes him a smile. The brunet man to the other side — Mr. Yang — remains silent despite appearing to have many questions on his mind.<br /><br />Before he knew it, he'd spent many a morning just like this.<br /><br />The process of re-visiting the route is not easy, mostly due to the numerous roadblocks caused by Stellaron. Sometimes, they would encounter the huge monsters he'd defeated before. They even found an enormous chunk of floating ice — encased in which was a living girl.<br /><br />That's why he wasn't very surprised when he detected that the boy/girl named Trailblazer has an actual Stellaron sealed inside his/her body.<br /><br />The Express' journey will continue on.
