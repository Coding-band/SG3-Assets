Unknown flowers bloomed in quiet valleys, nameless streams shimmered beneath the early spring sun. To her, many things had no names. She could only point and ask questions, again and again, to a certain knowledgeable companion.<br />Feeding the horses, chopping firewood, running until breathless... Her familiar life was about to draw to a close. But she didn't mind. Each night, she drifted off to sleep, dreaming of the adventures yet to come.<br /><br />\"A true king doesn't live that way.<br />\"A king must never stray from the castle, and that castle isn't made of stone or brick. Its foundation is the people's trust.<br />\"A king must not long for adventure. Every choice must come from deliberation, free from the pull of personal desire as much as possible.<br />\"A king must not pursue a life of their own. A king stands as the nation's symbol, and in every word they speak, no matter to whom, they must carry the strength to lead.\"<br /><br />To most, such a role would be an unbearable weight. But the mage who discovered the girl had a discerning eye — she took on the role with ease. Even presenting herself as a man raised no suspicion. Though, of course, a touch of magecraft helped with that.<br /><br />\"The funny thing is, her troubles didn't come from being bound by these rules.<br />\"It is quite the opposite — what she struggles with most is the loss of all her restraint.<br />\"Ah... I know, that's probably hard to grasp. Maybe it's better to explain with a more familiar example.\"<br /><br />At the edge of the cosmos lies a planet ravaged by harsh weather, where endless threats loom over humanity's fragile home. To protect it, the people appointed a \"king,\" and scheduled her every hour from dawn to dusk. And in doing so, the planet became one, united and ordered. Their efforts to defend their world fell into place with perfect precision.<br /><br />Years had passed when the king discovered blatant gaps appearing in her schedule. Though she felt rest was a luxury she couldn't afford, everyone around her offered various explanations. With her sharp intuition, she pierced through their words to the underlying truth: \"We no longer know what more we can do to make tomorrow better than today.\"<br /><br />\"To outside observers, the king seemed finally free to pursue her desires.<br />\"Yet the moment she considered her options, she realized that perhaps every choice she could now make was somehow wrong.<br />\"This is a terrifying negative spiral — the more thoughts you have, the fewer who truly understand your burden.\"<br /><br />This curse followed the king to her grave. <ruby>Her most trusted knight<rt>Lancelot</rt></ruby> parted ways with her, while <ruby>her most promising adopted child<rt>Mordred</rt></ruby> drew steel against her.<br />The kingdom she raised to greatness ultimately met its downfall through her own hands.<br /><br />\"If only someone more worthy had taken the throne.\" Such was her self-judgment in her dying breath.<br />But rest assured. The girl she is now no longer scrutinizes herself through such harsh eyes.<br /><br />\"If we consider the outcome, then everything transformed when I participated in that fateful Holy Grail War.<br />\"But please understand — the Holy Grail War was just an opportunity —<br />\"It stopped you in your headlong rush, allowing you to finally see the beauty that had always surrounded you.<br />\"I am still the king, and this is just another method of fulfilling my duty.<br />\"Like the flowers of spring... by the time you notice their beauty, you're usually only on time to witness them withering. Yet thankfully, though flowers eventually fade to soil, the branches that produced the bloom endure.<br />\"These branches, full of promise, will forever await <ruby>the next spring<rt>utopia's arrival</rt></ruby>.\"",
