Fishermen speak of a king of the seas who appears among the waves as a young child, with a fierce countenance and bluish lips, bathing in the bone-chilling waters of the Sea of Souls, wrestling with its savage beasts, thirsting for blood, and devouring flesh and bone.<br /><br />It is said that each time they sink to the seabed, they soon resurrect from the Sea of Souls. Over approximately nine years, they reforged themselves no less than ten thousand times, ultimately tearing apart a giant monster, staining the sea red for miles, yet no flesh-eating sea creature dared approach.<br /><br />Legends speak of how that the king of the seas could sweep countless fish and shrimp onto the shore with a flick of the tail. Once, shipwrecked fishermen praying for salvation were rescued by the king alongside his crew. As the tales grew more fantastical over time, fishermen started painting the king on their boats, in the hope it will grant them safe voyages.<br /><br />Rumors have emerged claiming that this so-called king of the seas is the vengeful spirit of the crown prince Mydeimos. Terrified by the prophecy he carried, his father, the former king, cast him into the Sea of Souls at birth. His life cut short, the child died with his grievances unredressed, vowing to scour the Sea of Souls. However, the writer believes this is merely the cunning Kremnoans trying to glorify themselves, for three reasons:<br /><br />First, though the Kremnoans traditionally engage in father-son struggles where the victor becomes king, why would they throw a newborn crown prince into the sea?<br />Second, even if King Eurypon of Kremnos, grown old and senile, believed the prophecy and sacrificed his heir to the sea, how could an infant possess the divine strength to battle giant monsters?<br />Third, even if such a child existed, he could hardly be Kremnoan. Why would a Kremnoan, known for their selfish and brutal nature as they are, assist fishermen struck by disaster?<br />Dear readers, I will now reveal the truth: the so-called king of the seas<br />— Naturally, he is the embodiment of the ocean itself!\"<br /><br /><align=\"right\">— Excerpt from \"Inquiry into the Legend of the Mighty Sea King\"<br />archived in the Gibranipar Library collection</align><br /><br />\"Strong.\"<br /><align=\"right\">— A man's handwriting</align>",

The leading warrior, the speartip, is always enveloped in unfathomable rage and hatred, thrusting towards the enemy.<br /><br />From Ladon, through Aidonia, to Aenionus, he returned from death time and again, leaving towering infernos of war in his wake. In the infamous Battle of Aenionus, the undefeated Klytius raised his massive axe as thousands of arrows darkened the sky behind him. Yet, when the smoke cleared and fire rose from the blood-soaked ground, the warrior's fist struck like a spear, tearing open Klytius's throat.<br /><br />After that epic battle, the true identity of the warrior became yet more elusive. That army clearly bore the marks of Kremnoan training but had never flown Kremnos's flag. None know whether they are Kremnoan spirits wandering on the battlefield or lost souls who have long been away from their homeland.<br /><br />Wandering bards turned the lone army's journey into mournful songs, while in the rust-flavored winds of Amphoreus, the lone lion led a group of old and weak soldiers as they wandered, searching for a nonexistent homeland.<br /><br />Reality will never alter its face due to cruelty. The once-elite citizens of Kremnos who followed him were loyal but mortal, lacking his god-like immortality. As time wore on, and even the gods of Kremnos succumbed to madness, how could humanity hope to know whither they should go?<br /><br />Will that proud, lonely man carry the weight of his people's fate alone?

Yet, the encirclement of the black tide around it has become unmistakably clear.<br /><br />For a thousand years, wherever the black tide has swept, life has been twisted into inhuman monstrosities, and city-states have been eroded by the wind into desolate ruins. Even a stronghold like Kremnos saw its gods tainted by the black tide, leaving nothing but wastelands in its wake.<br /><br />Most of the Coreflames had been restored, yet as the black tide approached, we found ourselves desperately short on time. All we have achieved will have been in vain should Okhema fall before the Era Nova.<br /><br />The author boldly speculated that, soon, the heroes chasing the flame would inevitably face a decisive battle against the black tide. Historical records showed that even the most valiant warriors could not endure long within the black tide. Among the Chrysos Heir heroes, if there was any hope for this battle, it would either rest upon the fearless Phainon or fall to Mydeimos.<br /><br />This wasn't merely because Mydeimos hailed as the bravest in this world, carried a destiny that defied death, nor was it solely because the old city of Kremnos occupied a strategic choke point against the black tide. Even though Mydeimos, like the lion of Kremnos, had migrated countless times in his life and ultimately settled far from his birthplace, the solitary king would never submit to foreign rule. Once he had settled his people, Mydeimos, who regarded his mission as his very essence, would undoubtedly return home. Yet, this time, he bore not only the hopes of the Kremnoans but also the future of the entire world.<br /><br />Talanton's priests once prophesied that the millennium of Strife that started in Kremnos would also find its end there. Perhaps, one day, that eternal figure will face the black tide — suspended between life and death.
