In each sweeping strike, he wielded his blade as if he'd already offered up his life without hesitation.<br /><br />Of course, more often than not, the young man greeted the world with humor and ease.<br />\"I just want people to feel comfortable around me,\" he would say.<br />Though his friends often scoffed at that, they knew it was that very spirit that earned the silver-haired youth the trust and respect of commoners and nobles alike in the holy city.<br /><br />During his years of study at the Grove, even though he had little interest in logic, the young man often triumphed in debates with his sharp wit after poring over books until the pages wore thin.<br />Though he could not outcompete his teacher's wisdom, deep down he knew — it was the courage to stay true to himself that he still lacked.<br /><br />Yet when the young man returned from the battlefield and after the physician had bandaged his wounds, there was still a long silence.<br />\"Lord Phainon... do you often wake in the night, or find yourself unable to sleep?\"<br /><br />He didn't mind.<br />To walk the path that would strike down the gods themselves, he had to carve himself into the shape the world needed him to be.<br />->->->->->->->->->->->->-><br /><b>>>> <nobr>49</nobr>th Computation<br />...<br />>>> Loading Scene <u>[Okhema]</u><br />>>> Loading Scene <u>[Grove of Epiphany]</u><br />...<br />>>> Load Computational Factors</b><br />\"HapLotes<nobr>405</nobr>\"<br />\"SkeMma<nobr>720</nobr>\"<br />\"EpieiKeia<nobr>216</nobr>\"<br />\"PoleMos<nobr>600</nobr>\"<br />\"EleOs<nobr>252</nobr>\"<br />...<br /><b>>>> Initiating Computation<br />...<br />>>> Object \"NeiKos<nobr>496</nobr>\" self-iteration progress: <nobr>0.43%</nobr></b>",

I've had this dream a thousand times before...\"<br />The boy rubbed his sleepy eyes as he woke beneath the tree.<br /><br />In the dream, the sun fell from the sky, the statue of a hero crumbling, melting, shattering, consuming the world in flames.<br />In the dead silence, a familiar figure, charred and broken, trudged alone into the endless darkness.<br /><br />\"That figure burned itself away... and everything else around it too...\"<br />The boy stared blankly at the unfinished wooden carving. The searing anger and deep self-loathing from the dream still echoed through his heart.<br />\"Maybe that broken world... is calling out for a hero...\"<br /><br />\"What will the future look like?\"<br />Lying back on the soft, golden straw, the boy pictured an epic tale unfolding before his eyes.<br />\"Maybe the hero will roam the world, righting wrongs, solving impossible problems, yet leaving no name behind...\"<br />\"Carrying a mysterious past, defying a cruel fate, and vanquishing fearsome enemies.\"<br />\"When the world teeters on the brink, they'll honor their vow with a heart pure and true — wherever they go, peace and prosperity will follow...\"<br />\"Even if they fall a hundred times, a thousand times, a million times... A hero can be destroyed, but never defeated...\"<br /><br />...<br /><br />If nothing had changed...<br />The days at Aedes Elysiae would have continued to drift by quietly, just as they always had.<br />That tiny ember had already been planted deep in his heart at the start of his journey.<br />When the boy grew into a young man, when he once again stood at the ferry, setting out toward distant lands...<br />He would rush toward the future, forgetting the broken dreams he left behind.<br />He wouldn't realize how long and arduous the road ahead would be — not until he had used himself as the kindling to feed a futile flame.<br />Only when he reached the end would he learn how far he had come.<br /><br />One last time, he would remember that morning when the sun first rose and who he was when he carved the first shape of his ideals. In the years to come, he would give that person a new name: \"Deliverer.\"<br /><br />And as for his own name, it would slowly scatter and fade from memory.<br />->->->->->->->->->->->->-><br /><b>>>> WARNING!<br />>>> WARNING!<br />>>> WARNING!</b><br />Error 7: Undefined object \"Trailblazer\" called<br />...<br />Error <nobr>12</nobr>: Unhandled type conversion<br />...<br />Error <nobr>99</nobr>: Invalid conditional statement<br />...<br /><b>>>> <nobr>33,550,337</nobr>th Calculation terminated<br />>>> Irontomb progress: <nobr>96.75%</nobr></b>",
