He contemplated his existence, pondering the nature of his being. Instead of lamenting his solitude, he focused on becoming a true knight.<br /><br />During his stay in an old city, he labored to restore its dilapidated streets.<br />He vanquished nightmarish monsters, and with the arrival of spring, rabbits frolicked once again in the woods.<br />He also briefly found companionship in the presence of another knight, who professed his faith in the blessings of the goddess residing within his armor.<br /><br />\"To give one's soul requires understanding that each encounter might be one's last, yet retreating is never an option.\"<br />\"Carry these words of courage with you, my dear friend.\"<br /><br />He contemplated on his lance, which bore the stains of countless battles fought in the name of Beauty.<br />With solemn reverence, he wiped away each mark, a testament to his tireless odyssey toward the pursuit of Beauty.",

His lance stood resolute at his side, blessed by the divine to retain its everlasting sharpness.<br />The echoes of his esteemed master and comrades transformed into whispers.

His armor transformed into the scaly hide of the behemoth he had slain, his weapon into unyielding claws and fangs, and his blood into a viscous and restless flame.
