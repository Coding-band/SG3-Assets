As they were immersed in a world of medicine and research, they were blithely unaware that a huge net woven by the hearts of men had already ensnared them.<br /><br />\"If you never learn how to face this world, your ideals will face only inevitable destruction.\"<br />She vowed to herself never to let something like this happen again.<br />Thanks to Yunhua's introduction, she was able to meet with the Zhuming High Elder Ardens Regia, and enter the Piercing Gaze sect to study specialist medical treatments such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, and pyropathy.<br />She fixed her previous pattern of turning a blind eye to the world around her and came to work alongside people of all walks of life harmoniously.<br /><br />As time passed, she realized that every type of person, every type of \"illness\" had their own unique scent.<br />She had smelled the putrid stench of envy.<br />While she studied at the Zhuming, she did not allow the mysterious disappearance of medicinal herbs and the subsequent misunderstandings and cold shoulders to crush her. She dispelled all doubts and mocking with incense that no seasoned alchemist could ever hope to match.<br />She had smelled the fetid stench of conspiracy, hypocrisy.<br />When working with biotechnology experts from other planets, she traced the thin veil of clues that revealed their schemes and thwarted their secret intentions to collude with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br />She had smelled the foul stench of covetous greed.<br />When she served as a Zhuming military healer, she came to understand the huge benefits of medicines hidden in the barracks and investigated in secret to expose corrupt members in one fell swoop.<br /><br />The \"afflictions\" of humanity had nowhere to hide under her diagnosis, she was always able to formulate the perfect \"incense\" to dispel their scent.<br />\"If I am unable to stand head and shoulders above my peers like my master, then I shall dedicate myself to learning the hearts of man and fighting them fair and square.\"<br />She changed her name to \"Lingsha.\"<br />Her medicinal namesake's fluctuation of yin and yang, its properties of both water and fire make it a miracle cure to those in mortal danger, just as she herself wished to become.",

   "text": "With her use of burning incense, she masterfully united the ways of Luofu alchemy and the teachings of the Zhuming's Piercing Gaze, to slowly become a healer known by every soul in the Alliance.<br /><br />When she received instruction to serve as Cauldron Master of the Luofu Alchemy Commission, she became a little preoccupied. However, upon arriving at the Luofu, she was disappointed to realize that not only had the Alchemy Commission not improved since she left, the internal conflict had in fact worsened.<br />\"The first issue is that people's interests are impure and nepotism is rife. Second, there is a lack of professional dedication and constant blame passing and squabbles. Third, an unjust rewards and punishment system has put people ill at ease. Fourth, research is dismissed as worthless and patient visits neglected. Fifth, those with power take all, those dedicated to improvement become discouraged and malpractice has been rampant for considerable time...\"<br />As she greeted others with a smile, she spent any time socializing secretly carving out an image in her heart of the problems she faced with each person.<br /><br />However, the problems within the Alchemy Commission were not created overnight, nor would they be solved as quickly.<br />Be it the fake platitudes of the Preceptors, the constant smoke and mirrors of the Alchemy Commission healers or conflicts with other departments, her worries were endless. She would have to use huge quantities of incense in order to keep her mind steady.<br />\"Don't get mad, don't be hasty, if I get sick then who'll replace me...\"<br />She would smile through gritted teeth as she read through reports that made her despair and massaged her temples for comfort.<br /><br />The waves still sounded outside her window.<br />As she watched the rising and falling of the ocean, she thought about how Yunhua must have spent her days like this back then.<br />\"Master, continuing to practice and learn in the face of the burdens of human affairs is no simple matter...\"<br />That young girl whose face was blackened by the exploding elixir crucible is now a grown woman, drowning in work and petty squabbles.",
