Mr. Horus has hired an entire starship, and we need to make our way to Basvia Starport for shelter.\"<br />\"But the commoners in the Silverchain have not heard of the storm, no?\"<br />\"We don't have a choice. It's to prevent possible riots.\"<br />\"...Leave if you want, but I'll stay here and seek that lady's help.\"<br />\"But this ion storm will obliterate all your wealth...\"<br />\"There are always things that can't be measured simply by price, such as... kindness and life.\"<br />The aged butler let out a deep sigh.<br /><br />The young lady walked into the pawn shop.<br />\"Welcome to Bonajade Exchange. Who are you? And what do you seek?\"<br />An unfamiliar and elegant voice rang from behind the curtain. <br />\"Oh, kind lady. The worries in your soul seem as turbulent as the raging calamity in the Silverchain Galaxy.\"<br />The speaker in the shadows emitted a warm light. The young lady looked up anxiously.<br />\"Yes, this is why I'm here. I seek... for a hope.\"<br />\"A hope of saving the Silverchain Galaxy, I see. What price will you pay in return?\"<br />\"The Oceanic Dream, the Sacred Blood, and the Jewel of the Century... Each of these gems would be sufficient to redeem ownership of an asteroid...\"<br />\"You know they are not nearly enough.\"<br />\"A lease on a third of the Silverchain Galaxy's mining industry... and the contract lasts for eternity.\"<br />\"Your sincerity is impressive, but I'm afraid that's still not enough.\"<br />\"But I don't have anything else to give to you...\"<br />\"Do you believe that everything in this world can be traded?\"<br />A hand reached out from the darkness, white and slender.<br />The young lady looked up, and the flicker that was fading in her eyes began to pulsate anew.<br />\"I will bring peace to the Silverchain Galaxy. As for the price... I want the entirety of you.\"<br />\"You will become the IPC's agent in the Silverchain Galaxy. From this moment on, every huff of your breath and every minute of your life will contribute to the Amber Lord's great cause...\"<br />\"Until the very end of your life.\"",

Who are you? And what do you seek?\"<br />For countless times, she repeated the greeting, awaiting the desires from the entire cosmos to surge toward her.<br /><br />A beautiful dancer came to her, seeking the possibility of eternal beauty. She took a portion of her lifespan and granted her access to the Intelligentsia Guild. Time and time again, the dancer regained her youthful years, only to return again when age caught up with her. Until one day, she left hiding her face in her hands, never to return.<br /><br />A soldier from a fallen country pledged all his emotions for the chance of vengeance. Having lost all grief and anger, he transformed into a war machine sowing death. Eventually, he eradicated all his former enemies and was forever trapped in his past, leaving only scorched earth in the aftermath — territories that later fell under the IPC's possession.<br /><br />A couple from Baviru traded their memories in exchange for absolute wealth. They visited her Bonajade Exchange at different stages of their lives, seeking wealth, fame, and social standing... until they had squandered all of their memories. They lived a content life, only to forget it all in the end.<br /><br />Rumor circulated that anything could be used as collateral at the Bonajade Exchange, and even those without any possessions would have a chance to gain a new lease of life.<br />\"You call that charity!? Nah, she's an evil witch! A cursed demon who enjoys collecting souls!\"<br />\"Never ever talk to her, or you'll end up losing everything...\"<br />\"You're talking about Lady Bonajade? No, she's not like that at all! Without her help, my hometown would have been taken over as a colony ages ago.\"<br />...<br />She listens to the rumors about her circulating among the stars, but she pays them no mind.<br />\"There is but a thin line between right and wrong, and good and evil.\"<br />\"Once a desire, however tiny it is, is ignited, more desires will ensue.

What price will you pay in return?\" she asked, a smile playing on her lips.<br />\"Our Cornerstones.\" the young lady replied.<br />\"And my life, too.
