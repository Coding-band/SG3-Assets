However, once the boy had experienced the cruelty of the front lines first-hand, he never regained that warm feeling in his heart. Luka would secretly observe his comrades' expressions every time they lined up for action — and the apprehension he saw on those faces would actually soothe his own anxiety.<br /><br />A scream pulls Luka back to reality. He rushes toward where the sound came from and sees a helpless child being backed into a corner by a monster. Instinctively, he leaps out and puts himself between the sharp ax and the child's fragile form.<br /><br />A loud blast sounds from behind him. Luka hugs the panicked boy with one arm and slowly turns his head. The mutated monster had fallen to the ground, seemingly hit in the vitals by a stray bullet.<br /><br />\"Th—Thank you... mister...\"<br /><br />\"Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?\"<br /><br />\"Mister... your... your arm...\"<br /><br />His eyes follow the direction the child is pointing at.
