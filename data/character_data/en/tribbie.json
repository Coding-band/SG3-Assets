The roadside springs tasted of hoeny and milk, and the trees were heavy with endless fruit. As we walked on, the moon and stars climbed the sky — that was Tri▇ gliding among them! Ahead of us was also Tri▇, Tri▇, Tri▇... It turns out everyone was waiting for us at the destination!<br /><br />Look, there in the distance, Mother is greeting us!
