Unfortunately, the loud <s>witch</s> teacher said my voice sounded like a snarl, and I sang like a duckling, so she sent me out for punishment. And guess what? I ended up eating a fourth tart outside the classroom!<br /><br />Fortunately, I've been practicing the piano diligently, and Mr. Big Guy always praises my talent. Now, I can play a melody in its original form after hearing it just once — just as awesome as you! When you come back next time, we can play together as a duet on the same piano, and we can have another concert!<br /><br />You don't need to worry about our little bird. It's been flying a bit higher each day. With the lovely weather we've been having lately, I'm sure it will be able to take flight soon! This afternoon, while I was tending to mom's grave, I spotted several birds looking like our bird. I know our little one will join them before long!<br /><br />How time flies! I've recently begun taking Family lessons from the Bronze Melodia in the church. That means — I'm gonna become a super, super awesome person in the future! Then, we will surely transform the Dreamscape into a super, super good place in the future!<br /><br />I've mailed some SoulGlad with innovative flavors together with this letter. Some of them are a bit unusual, but they're fun, and I really want you to give them a try. If you enjoy them, I'll be happy to send more!<br />(And if you come across any delicious pudding tarts, send some on my way too!)<br />Don't overwork yourself!<br /><br /><br /><align=\"right\">Support you always!<br />Your big brother\"<br /><br />— An old family letter, hidden in the secret compartment of a suitcase</align>",

The record store on Penacony is now bustling with activity, and posters of your new album are adorning the streets everywhere. There are so many people complimenting you and asking if they can get your autograph.<br /><br />It's probably for the best that you're not coming back right now. Penacony has changed. Dreamchasers are flocking in, and the economy is booming like never before. However, the Dreamscape has become much more chaotic than it used to be. I never would have imagined that the Bronze Melodia would face such significant challenges.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs have imposed extremely unreasonable working hours to monopolize the industry, forcing workers in the Dreamscape to work twelve-hour shifts before they can take a break — only to receive meager paychecks in return. Speculative and high-risk industries are all over Penacony, where dreamchasers arrive with lofty aspirations, only to find themselves among the destitute...<br /><br />Recently, a stowaway approached me for help, explaining that he had spent everything he had just to stay on Penacony, only to be discovered by the Bloodhound Family. He assured me that he would repay all his debts later, which is why I asked the Bloodhound Family to show him some leniency. However, every time I consider how many others like him there are on Penacony, I can't help but wonder if everyone has the opportunity to make the right choices.<br /><br />If I've calculated correctly, you should be starting your next concert tour by the time this letter reaches you. You don't have to worry about Penacony. I know you are a kind person, but not everyone shares your heart. Always remember to take care of yourself.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">There For You Always, <br />Sunday\"<br /><br />— A yellowed family letter, stored in a record case.</align>",

Your suspicions are correct. This matter is indeed linked to the deaths you observed, and it's even more connected to the mysterious Watchmaker. But since you have been away from Penacony for a long time and may not be familiar with the situation here, I would advise that you refrain from acting rashly.<br /><br />Regarding your loss of voice, your top priority should be to recuperate. If you are genuinely unwell, I will consult the Dreammaster about the Charmony Festival to see if we can have a special arrangement. You believe the loss of voice stems from the impure nature of Penacony's Harmony, and I concur.

In my current position, there's little I can do to make amends except to eliminate the lingering echoes of Order that remain on Penacony. By doing this, I can ensure that there are no more hidden dangers of Order in the Dreamscape.<br /><br />To catch a glimpse of the sky, even a bird with a broken wing will choose to take flight again. Just like the little bird we raised together as children, it soared into the heavens despite knowing it might fall — because that was its destiny. I will never forget our shared wish to \"make everyone happy,\" but now I must embark on a journey to seek fulfillment in the wider world. This is my destiny and my choice.<br /><br />Mr. Yang has granted me permission to board the Express and travel as a passenger in search of my promised land. They are kind and of noble character. You should know them better than I do.<br /><br />Many times, even when you don't say it, I still see you as a child who needs protection. But you've long since grown up, and I'm truly relieved that Penacony has you.<br /><br />I have tended to Mom's grave and picked a blue flower to carry with me.
