Care to try one of my new medicines?\"<br />With a smile, he put away the wrist cushion and golden needles, bringing out a whole new set of medical tools.<br />As the elderly man gazed at the nine-squared cauldron in front of him, he couldn't help but break into a wry smile.<br />\"Others can hardly even invent a few decent medicines in their lifetimes, yet a single day is all you need to achieve that and more.\"<br />\"You flatter me, Master. This cauldron-based medicinal formula is called the 'nine-squared grid.' Not only is it simple to make, but its effects are also wondrous.\"<br />The youth poured out the ingredients from his basket, cleaning them quickly before slicing them. As he did, the stock inside the cauldron began to bubble and boil.<br />\"A tael of euphorbia, three mace of bitterwood, and four cash of desert cistanche... Boil with big bones, then pair with deep sea shellfish to dispel the bitter flavor. The concoction can aid one in achieving peaceful slumber.\" \"As for the white loach and threadfin snapper, their constitution-warming properties are great for nourishing the qi and blood. We need only dip the slices in boiling water for two to three seconds.\"<br />\"These green mushrooms, silver needle tea leaves, and snow lotus roots were all carefully cultivated with decoction dregs by me at Rainsoar Lake. Not only are they tasty and refreshing, but they also offer medicinal benefits.\"<br />As glistening fish slices met boiling soup, both master and disciple enjoyed a delicious meal that quickly made them forget about the damp coldness of a rainy day.<br /><br />In the aftermath of the meal, the older man put down his chopsticks, seemingly having realized something.<br />\"This meal that I've just had, the 'nine-squared grid'... It seems there is more you wish to tell me with this meal than what I'd thought.\"<br />The youth stood up and solemnly bowed.<br />\"Master, you are perceptive indeed. I have long since made up my mind about whether to join the Alchemy Commission.\"<br />\"While the Alchemy Commission is a good place to be, it is ultimately not compatible with my wish to practice medicine for the masses. The one place that requires a healer the most is undeniably the battlefield where the Yaoqing's forces are.\"<br />\"Among the many schools of healers, only practitioners of the Ranzhi School — such as you and me — place emphasis on the tenet of 'food is medicine,' using the joy of food to alleviate the pain of ailments... The 'nine-squared grid,' with its convenience and effectiveness in dispelling the cold that ails one's constitution, was specially made by me to provide succor to those on the battlefield.\"<br />\"For those who yet breathe, there is nothing more important than the preservation of life. If I could deliver the people from pain and suffering with a mere medicinal formula, the Alchemy Commission's time and effort spent in grooming my talents would be well-spent indeed.\"<br />The elder looked as though he wanted to talk the youth out of his decision, but he ultimately decided against it.<br />\"The battlefield is a bitterly cold place...

The cold did not bother him in the slightest, even with the snow flurries pelting at him.<br />When the bugle call sounded yet again, the army was equipped and ready to depart. The field hospital will soon be burdened with grievously wounded soldiers like before. Yes, he has the skills to bring the wounded back from the gates of hell, but these young lives still end up lost in the endless, ravenous war.<br /><br />Every night, he would always talk with General Yueyu. This day, however, he was uncharacteristically silent for a long time.<br />\"Recently, I have been thinking... If the patients that I nurse to health are destined to hurtle toward death once more, what is my purpose as a healer?\"<br /><br />A dull cry sounded from the direction of the wards.

A light so blindingly bright that tore the sky dome asunder.<br />Even mountains and hills that the light reached turned into dust.<br />He saw the Abominations of Abundance and members of the Xianzhou Legion that were slow to retreat crumble to dust.<br />He heard about how the girl always by General Yueyu's side weaved in and out of the annihilated enemy ranks, attempting to bring the remaining soldiers back with her.<br />Before the wave of light could reach them, he dashed in with every last ounce of his strength to save that young lady before losing his consciousness in the afterglow of the obliterating light.<br />...<br />Tattered banners thrashed in the wind as the few remaining survivors gathered around the bonfire in silence.<br />Clank, clank, clank...<br />A strong gust of wind swept across, rolling a battered cauldron along the barren ground.<br /><br />His body should have long acclimated to the frigid cold climate given the time he had been stationed on this planet.
