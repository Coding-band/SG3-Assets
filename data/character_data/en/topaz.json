Those results can be seen from the monthly job report filed by the team. The only purpose of this report is to recommend a particular member of my team to you: ███ ████.<br /><br />I trust that you have heard of ███ ████'s experiences and achievements in some fashion or another. I have included in the system her work reports and the comprehensive feedback given by multiple personnel in the team, for your perusal. Though she is still young, ███ has demonstrated exceptional business acumen, managerial thinking, strength of character and ability to perform under pressure. I have no doubt that, if she were to assume the leadership responsibilities of Marketing Team <nobr>166</nobr>, this team's profits and project success rate will be significantly elevated. I also believe that ███'s career will most certainly not stop here, not with the potential she has shown so far. She will definitely rise to bigger and better things in the future. Therefore, once I retire to the backlines, I hope you would be able to look out for ███ ████ — We here at the Strategic Investment Department have always believed that talent is the best investment, and I trust that you already have had your eyes on her.<br /><br />Marketing Team <nobr>166</nobr>, Strategic Investment Department<br />Francisco Dvorski",

This is your farewell party, after all. Let's wait for a bit longer.\"<br /><br />\"Haha... I know what these brats are like. All of them only think about working and earning money... They've probably forgotten about their old leader ages ago.\"<br /><br />\"...I'm very sorry, Mr. Dvorski. I originally thought that at least Jelena would...\"<br /><br />\"...Hey, don't use that name. Now you need to call her 'Topaz.' Honestly, I never imagined that she would become one of them...\"<br /><br />\"You've gotta acknowledge her achievements, Destor. Stubborn old bones like me won't get anywhere near that position even if I worked here for a few more lifetimes. She's already a part of a different world. How would she possibly have the time to come to this small party?\"<br /><br />\"You're being too humble. I feel that... Ah, there's a knock on the door! Stay where you are. I'll get it.\"<br /><br />\"...Who is it, Destor? My eyesight is getting worse in my old age. I can't even tell who they are even if they're standing right in front of me...\"<br /><br />\"I'm so sorry, sir. No one came... It was just a letter being delivered.\"<br /><br />\"Oh... I see. Who's the letter from? Such formality. They could have just sent an electronic message...\"<br /><br />\"There's no name written on the envelope. Hold on. I'll read the letter to you —\"<br /><br />\"Dear Mr. Dvorski, Thank you for your constant support and help over the years! I would definitely not be where I am today without your care and mentorship. I offer my deepest apologies for being unable to attend your retirement farewell party — I am currently working abroad at Taikiyan. Once this project is over, I will definitely take a whole day off and go visit you. Also, I seem to recall that you are into Roboball — So I'm going to bring back some souvenirs for you from Taikiyan. Yours Faithfully Forever, Jelena.\"<br /><br />\"...\"<br /><br />\"Mr... Dvorski? Are you... crying?\"",
