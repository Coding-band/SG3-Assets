   "text": "Reporter: Francisco Dvorski<br />Reportee: Jade<br />Report Content: Team Lead Work Report<br /><br />Madam Jade:<br /><br />This should be the last time I send you a work report through the system. Time flies. In the blink of an eye, I've already worked for half an Amber Era at the Strategic Investment Department, and only managed to climb to my current position through many trials and hardship. I may not be able to call myself distinguished, but I have at least gathered enough wealth for the next few generations of my family. I desire nothing else. Here, I would like to specifically thank the phenomenal support you've constantly given to Marketing Team <nobr>166</nobr>, Madam Jade.<br /><br />Anyway, I will not waste any time presenting the recent deliverables and outcomes achieved by Marketing Team <nobr>166</nobr> in this work report. Those results can be seen from the monthly job report filed by the team. The only purpose of this report is to recommend a particular member of my team to you: ███ ████.<br /><br />I trust that you have heard of ███ ████'s experiences and achievements in some fashion or another. I have included in the system her work reports and the comprehensive feedback given by multiple personnel in the team, for your perusal. Though she is still young, ███ has demonstrated exceptional business acumen, managerial thinking, strength of character and ability to perform under pressure. I have no doubt that, if she were to assume the leadership responsibilities of Marketing Team <nobr>166</nobr>, this team's profits and project success rate will be significantly elevated. I also believe that ███'s career will most certainly not stop here, not with the potential she has shown so far. She will definitely rise to bigger and better things in the future. Therefore, once I retire to the backlines, I hope you would be able to look out for ███ ████ — We here at the Strategic Investment Department have always believed that talent is the best investment, and I trust that you already have had your eyes on her.<br /><br />Marketing Team <nobr>166</nobr>, Strategic Investment Department<br />Francisco Dvorski",

This is your farewell party, after all. Let's wait for a bit longer.\"<br /><br />\"Haha... I know what these brats are like. All of them only think about working and earning money... They've probably forgotten about their old leader ages ago.\"<br /><br />\"...I'm very sorry, Mr. Dvorski. I originally thought that at least Jelena would...\"<br /><br />\"...Hey, don't use that name. Now you need to call her 'Topaz.' Honestly, I never imagined that she would become one of them...\"<br /><br />\"You've gotta acknowledge her achievements, Destor. Stubborn old bones like me won't get anywhere near that position even if I worked here for a few more lifetimes. She's already a part of a different world. How would she possibly have the time to come to this small party?\"<br /><br />\"You're being too humble. I feel that... Ah, there's a knock on the door! Stay where you are. I'll get it.\"<br /><br />\"...Who is it, Destor? My eyesight is getting worse in my old age. I can't even tell who they are even if they're standing right in front of me...\"<br /><br />\"I'm so sorry, sir. No one came... It was just a letter being delivered.\"<br /><br />\"Oh... I see. Who's the letter from? Such formality. They could have just sent an electronic message...\"<br /><br />\"There's no name written on the envelope. Hold on. I'll read the letter to you —\"<br /><br />\"Dear Mr. Dvorski, Thank you for your constant support and help over the years! I would definitely not be where I am today without your care and mentorship. I offer my deepest apologies for being unable to attend your retirement farewell party — I am currently working abroad at Taikiyan. Once this project is over, I will definitely take a whole day off and go visit you. Also, I seem to recall that you are into Roboball — So I'm going to bring back some souvenirs for you from Taikiyan. Yours Faithfully Forever, Jelena.\"<br /><br />\"...\"<br /><br />\"Mr... Dvorski? Are you... crying?\"",
