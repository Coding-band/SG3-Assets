Drink this...\"<br />\"Suffering is temporary... you shall have a full life once more. you will not die in this mo... ment—\"<br />In a flash, the speaker collapses to the ground. The black-clad shadow guard appears in the light before them and stands solemnly. Silence can not conceal the murderous rage that once again wells up inside him.<br />...<br />\"These people are no longer people. They feel no pain... What about you, though? With wounds like those, are you going to tell me you feel no pain?\"<br />The foxian healer sprinkles powder on his wounds and chatters away as always.<br />\"We were originally here for reconnaissance. I told you we had a large force ready for backup. Why did you go ahead and take action?\"<br />He does not say a word, simply looking down at the sharp, blood-coated dagger in his hands.<br />Over the years, through each and every mission he had completed, he had long since come to understand just what that former \"family\" of his was. However, he refuses to think about it in depth, nor would he acknowledge that his view had changed from all those years ago. If he did, what meaning would his vengeance and their vow have?<br /><br />\"Does that hurt?\"<br />\"...\" He still refuses to speak.<br />The foxian healer decides to speed up his movements, wrapping his wounds in gauze and casually pressing down a little too hard.<br />\"Ow...\"<br />\"If it hurts, then say it out loud. What good does enduring your pain do? Just seeing you like this is agony for me.\"<br />He nods.<br /><br />He has become accustomed to not speaking, but also to having people speak on his behalf.",
