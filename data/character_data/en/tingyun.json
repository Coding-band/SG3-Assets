If Sandcitrus seeds from the Bitterwater Confederacy are transplanted into the sacred soils of Vonwacq, then they will grow into sweet oranges. This is naturally due to the fertile and balanced soils of Vonwacq. And if the lightfish fry from Thalassa are introduced to my world and raised by the Vidyadhara at Scalegorge Waterscape, they can double in size to over three feet long.\"<br /><br />\"The Whistling Flames' latest plan is to carefully select species with commercial potential, and relay them via trade starskiffs for safe transport. Within one month, you'll get the first batch of goods back. These goods would add to the glamours of the crystal palace at the bottom of the Thalassan abyss, and can even become a unique trading products for your nation.\"<br /><br />The man with gills blows out a few bubbles, which represents a slightly hesitant agreement in his culture. Then, his larynx pronounces some wondrous syllables: \"I thought the Whistling Flames were speculative traders involved in arbitrage. Are you planning to change the current situation in the logistics industry, where the IPC reigns supreme? Tell me, how much do you want?\"<br /><br />\"For a return service, we take ninety percent. A broker just flips product from one hand to the other. Or rather, from one finned limb to the other. As the saying goes, \"Real business talks no profit.\" Only by benefiting others can we hope to benefit ourselves. As long as the Lord of the Abyss in the Crystal Palace assents, then I'd like to enter into a contr— Ahem, I mean a permanent partnership. What do you say?\"<br /><br />On this day, Tingyun not only closed on a deal, but also formed a new friendship for the Alliance.",

Their lightning-fast reflexes and keen senses have resulted in this, and it also makes for cheeky, playful juvenile foxians. But Tingyun? This pointy-eared girl always looks fluffy and soft. Not only does she not vigorously pull on others' fur when meeting someone, she herself remains calm even if someone pulls on her fur. With an innocent smile and her sweet voice, she would even urge the other person to stop...<br /><br />It's not hard to understand differences in human nature. But compared to her foxian peers all busy tearing up their homes, Tingyun — who'd never been any good at combat — frustrated her parents who both served in the military at the Sky-Faring Commission. Seeing as Tingyun wouldn't inherit the family business, the two shook off their prejudices and let their daughter blossom freely...<br /><br />As a result, a dazzling new star of trade dawned aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. With her warm personality and talented skills, this foxian girl successively completed trade missions to sixteen different planets, and re-signed another bilateral agreement with the IPC. The famous Xianzhou trade bonanza — the Grand Fair — also developed into a famous fiesta under her advocacy.",

And she considers booby-traps like darts and needles to be too toxic and disgraceful.<br /><br />After thinking over things, Tingyun finally chose this carved reticulated fan. Put into her own words, here's why:<br /><br />\"Business people cherish peace above all else. Carrying a weapon dishonors friendships and makes for bad business.\"<br /><br />\"My fan is different from a weapon. I can use it to cool myself off as well as cooling off a nasty business client. It's best if we can just have a nice chat, but if things don't go smoothly...\"<br /><br />\"...Then I just have to fan them harder, and cool them off until they know I mean business!\"",

Meanwhile, Tingyun doesn't have the knack for driving a starskiff, let alone a skill for killing. That's the main difference between her and the current Helm Master of the Sky-Faring Commission, Yukong.<br /><br />What's more, Yukong has already planned on handing over the future to Tingyun, but Tingyun doesn't know if she's truly qualified to take it on.<br /><br />To her, Yukong is not merely a trustworthy superior or even a savior during a crisis. In her heart, Yukong is also a kind of glorious idol. She views Yukong as someone to entrust her spirits in, as a beacon to guide her. She wants to hold onto that starlight, but has discovered that she can only chase in desperation from the shadows. Until one day, that lone star said to her:<br /><br />\"Times are changing. Xianzhou is changing. One day, this giant ship will grow utterly exhausted of a sky full of blood and war. When that time comes, the Sky-Faring Commission will be your stage.\"<br /><br />She didn't know how much of what was said was a joke, but she carefully sealed these words into the envelope and locked it in the back of the drawer at her store. She resolved to never forget.<br /><br />\"Even if I can't go into battle, there's still a chance for me to show my strength.\" Says the foxian girl to herself. The Luofu is currently moored in orbit, undergoing re-invigoration after a campaign against the abominations. Flourishing commerce becomes the backdrop to this era.<br /><br />Understanding Yukong's expectations of her, Tingyun flies beyond the skies, seeking more alliances and friendships.<br /><br />\"When it comes to who is the best helm master on the Luofu, people will naturally say Madam Yukong's the champion. But if you ask me...\"<br />\"My skillful oratory must count for some kind of helm mastery, right?\"",
