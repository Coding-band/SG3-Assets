Anyone traveling in or out of the Luofu could see a vast gate when looking up, where a spacial membrane twirls like a torrent. The gate stands alone with no walls and admits the ships coming and going. It is a grand sight to see.<br /><br />This skygate is called the Jade Gate, and it's the entrance to the Xianzhou delves. Below the gate, travelers stream inside on their way into the Luofu. Among them is a young girl wearing a peach-colored dress, likely of <nobr>16</nobr> or <nobr>17</nobr> years old, but difficult to judge her true age as a Xianzhou native — nor could anyone guess what strange force has helped her hold that enormous greatsword in her hand.<br /><br />At two feet and one inch long, it's very unusual. Despite being wrapped in white cloth, it still looks like an antique. Yet it is a true weapon as the edges on both sides of the blade are as thin as cicada wings, sharp enough to even cut a strand of hair. People come to stare at this soldier girl, raising their eyebrows. But the girl seems to be accompanied by worry, merely frowning in annoyance as she mutters:<br />\"How strange! Mother taught me how to chant this mantra so that I could focus. Why isn't it working now?\"<br /><br />Without waiting for her to utter any more obscure words, a Vidyadhara man at the custom raised his hand and waves the girl over: \"Next, please!\" The girl is startled and grits her teeth tightly — but she has to bite the bullet and steps forward.<br /><br />\"Gold can be smelted, but an oath...\" The girl says sternly to the Vidyadhara man.<br />\"Gold can be smelted, but an oath cannot be broken\". The Vidyadhara man blankly replies: \"This is the customs office. What oath? Name, origin, reason for travel — just give me these.\"<br />She is dumbfounded, and figures she'd gotten her Luofu anecdote wrong. Helpless, she could only pick up her Foursquare Mirror and respond: <br />\"Name: Sushang; personal belongings: One Xuanyuan sword. Origin:...\"<br />\"Tsk, how do you write 'Yaoqing' again?\"",

   "text": "It has been some time since Sushang answered the call of the Luofu's Cloud Knights. She keeps herself busy patrolling the streets, but never runs into any criminal activity, which leaves her even more annoyed and angry. In the end, she has no choice but to practice sword training and listen to storytelling in her spare time. These boring days stretch on endlessly.<br /><br />One day, she is lying on the table at the Sleepless Earl, waiting for the storyteller to get prepared and tell his tale of the Luofu's High-Cloud Quintet. But before the gavel could fall, her Cloud Knight peer bursts through the door, screaming out: <br />\"Sushang, come now! The Outworlders are making trouble again!\"<br /><br />After hearing the shout, her eyes widen instantly, and she quickly picks up her greatsword to rush to the scene. Upon arriving, she sees a redhead woman performing sword-swallowing and fire-breathing, which send the crowd into hysterics. Before long, this woman is somehow pulling out a green granite slab, determined to perform a \"Smashing Boulder on Chest\" trick.<br /><br />\"Stop! The traffic here has always been a problem. This isn't your darned circus, okay!?\" Sushang shouts out sternly, steeling her stance as she heaves her Xuanyuan sword and points it at the woman. The woman notices her lack of stability and stays calm, side-stepping her before spinning up the fire-stick once more to great astonishment.<br /><br />\"I'll leave then out of respect!\" Says the redhead loudly. And with a wave of her hand, the blunt end of the redhead's spear stabs straight towards Sushang's clenched hands. Sushang backs away a pace, whereupon the woman unexpectedly takes several round objects out of her pouch, smashing them onto the ground to send smoke and fire in every direction, causing an incessant sound of explosions. When Sushang comes to, she realizes that the woman has disappeared: <br />\"What the heck was that... firecrackers!?\"<br />\"This Outworlder... Cannot be underestimated!\"",

   "text": "Dearest Mother and Father,<br /><br />How have you two been? I've been fighting alongside the Cloud Knights on the Luofu for some time now as per your request, so that's something to report. I think I should share it here with the both of you!<br /><br />In my opinion, the most important event lately should be... me independently handling someone dangerous without relying on anyone else! This Outworlder always goes around making trouble, and always packs lots of explosives, threatening public safety. But this person is forced into this by vicissitudes of life. Inspired by me, she decided to turn over a new page — and now, we're even close friends!<br /><br />I also follow your advice and continue to practice swordcraft every day. I feel like I've been making great progress. If I can go home and show you two, I think you'd be pleased with my progress!<br /><br />I remembered back when I set off that you asked me not be too whimsical and train myself with the army. Well, now I've practiced a lot here, I am gradually becoming more mature. I still have so much to learn, but I can looking after myself now! So you both don't have to worry about me!<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Sushang</align><br /><align=\"right\">October <nobr>21</nobr></align>",

   "text": "Sushang:<br /><br />Reading your letter is almost as good as seeing you again in person. The two of us are safe and sound, so don't worry about us.<br /><br />As for your recent situation you described in your letter, we understand and are deeply gratified. In addition, we've added some new instructions here and hope you're able to make an effort with these.<br /><br />Firstly, when making friends, you should consider if they're good or bad. Sushang, you're now old enough for courtship, but you still don't understand how unpredictable and dangerous the world can be. Your collusion with hoodlums has worried and aggrieved us. Straight-forward, trustworthy, and knowledgeable people are good and should make good friends. But expedient, soft, and flattering people are no good, and should be avoided.<br /><br />Secondly, don't strive to achieve grandiose things. We know you've always been anxious about justice, but your letter seems to have fact mixed in with fiction, or at the very least be greatly exaggerated. An old saying in Xianzhou goes, \"As reputation is never easily gained, so glory cannot be coincidence.\" It's not good to make achievements and then boast about them. Keep in mind: We Xianzhou people live forever, so fleeting fame and fortune pass through our fingers into the sands of time. It's why you need to build up a strong foundation and focus on the practical, being meticulous and careful as if skating on thin ice. One slip and you'll get into trouble, fall into the grasps of mara, and bear the consequences for life!<br /><br />PS: Keep your sword sharp every day, and don't forget to recite your Blade Swara to focus your spirit. The mind is the basis of martial arts, and when your mind gets refined into the formless, you can know that the sword is nothing but another crutch to rely on. Grass, wood, stone, bamboo and the alike can all make swords. Follow your heart and energies freely. It will take many a day yet for you to eventually tame your Xuanyuan sword.<br /><br />PPS: You made a lot of writing errors, Sushang. Please read more books while you're off duty. And it's \"look after myself,\" not \"looking after myself.\"<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Suyi</align><br /><align=\"right\">October <nobr>22</nobr></align>",
