However, the offense exhibited unprecedented ferocity.<br />\"No, this is not an ordinary attack! It's the Swarm... the Swarm!\"<br />The voices in her comms trembled as more and more of the Iron Cavalry soared to the sky like sparkling fire, only to be swallowed by the encroaching darkness as soon as they ignited.<br />\"Hold the line! Push forward!\"<br /><br />In her line of sight, countless numbers of the Iron Cavalry fell.<br />Are there any of them that have spoken to her? It was a realization that struck her for the first time.<br />So... each person is unique?<br /><br />Finally, an opening was created within the Swarm, and from it emerged the Swarm Mother, advancing slowly.<br />Like a streak of light, she skillfully navigated through the dense swarm, racing alongside her fellow Iron Cavalry comrades toward the mouthpiece of the towering Silver Sting. Just as the Swarm Mother was about to devour her, she closed her eyes, detonating a bomb with enough firepower to obliterate an entire planet.<br /><br />A blinding light erupted, engulfing the Swarm Mother, plunging everything into silence.<br />Like a kite severed from its string, she was propelled by the tremendous impact, descending toward the ground. Fleeting memories that she would never forget flickered before her eyes...<br /><br />Beside the lake where fyreflies danced, she shed her armor, relishing the refreshing breeze and coolness of the night.<br />She observed fyreflies alighted on the back of her hand, their wings gracefully fluttering.<br />\"...Despite their tiny size, they shine brighter than the stars at night.\"<br /><br />Darkness enveloped her.<br />The remnants of the Swarm and her shattered armor disintegrated, dissipating like silent snowfall across the universe.",
