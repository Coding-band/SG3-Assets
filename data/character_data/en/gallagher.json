While his clothes are tidy, they are always wrinkled and display a lack of style. He also displays no desire to look after his appearance. He doesn't have many friends, and his favorite pastime after work is enjoying a few glasses of Dreamjoy Special. Always sitting at the same spot, with the same drink, and with the same waiters... It's never changed in more than a decade.<br /><br />Yet such a man won the admiration and respect of the Bloodhound Family members — this is probably related to the scar etched across his face. In a sweet dream practically devoid of any accidents, an ugly scar serves as a rare honor for a security officer, symbolizing seniority and prestige.<br /><br />Whenever confronted with a case, he would first unwrap a piece of candy and put it in his mouth. When the candy is almost gone with his chewing, he dives into the investigation with furrowed brows and ponders the clues until late in the bar. However, unlike the young officers, he seems to no longer find pleasure in apprehending suspects. When he gazes into the eyes of the so-called criminals who fell so far in the sweet dream, I see no sense of accomplishment in his eyes, only a profound emptiness and melancholy.<br /><br />I actually understand him. When you reach this stage of life, you'll start to doubt the meaning behind the life you've previously led. It was just like what I have experienced.\"<br /><align=\"right\">— Note: The Security Officer of the Bloodhound Family</align>",

Then, he talks about the degrees of fit between the special mix's aroma with an individual's personality, and how to master the secret of matching the right ingredients... The surrounding faces drown in darkness. He listens to the whispers of sorrow or joy, all the while coldly observing the hearts of the masses as the drinking party continues.<br /><br />He waits for all the guests to depart, then polishes the silver cups on his own until they gleam while gazing out the door. Day after day, he waits for someone who will never return, waiting for that person to give him an eternal lie that will end such a never-ending destiny.<br /><br />He walks alone down the street as lights go out one after another, and he casts a long shadow behind him —<br />Perhaps I, too, will step on to the same predetermined path as he is on.\"<br /><align=\"right\">— Note: Dreamjoy Drinksmith</align>",

As glasses clink, those conversations flow and fizzle like foams, then instantly disappear.<br /><br />He reminisces about the golden years when he yearned for freedom despite his captivity.
