   "text": "He felt as if he was back on the speeding Astral Express.<br />He watched as the Express ventured into the vast unknown, blazing trails never traveled before.<br /><br />In the endlessly stretching path through space, he saw a giant dragon soaring through chaos.<br />It once slumbered in its egg, until one day it emerged in rebirth.<br />It met others of its kind, sharing the same bloodline and path.<br />It stirred vast spirit waters, bringing rain and nourishing all living things.<br />It upheld the earth of gold and stone, protecting the eternal prosperity of all nations...<br />Its path still winds toward the future.<br />War's flames licked its scales, and from that heat, it shed its old scales time and time again, gaining rebirth.<br />Then, together with the express, it leaped toward the future.<br /><br />...<br /><br />\"You know, in the future, if the Express gets covered in a layer of cosmic barnacles that won't wash off, Dan Heng can use his... Dragonquake Boom to sand them away!\"<br />\"Great idea. Look, Dan Heng's waking up... Want to bet whether it was a good dream or...\"<br /><br />\"You guys are too noisy...\"<br />As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Trailblazer and March whispering loudly next to his ear.<br />\"Come on, spill it! Falling asleep at a time like this. What sweet dreams were you having?\"<br /><br />March stretched lazily, gazing into the distance with anticipation.<br />\"Let me guess, did you dream about what's going to happen on our upcoming journey?\"<br />\"...\"<br />\"Do you even need to ask? Of course we're gonna beat up all the bad guys!\"<br /><br />The wind that blew then seemed to carry the aroma of breakfast from the Express.<br />\"Let's... go home together.\"<br /> He made a silent vow, as he had in the past, and would in the future.",
