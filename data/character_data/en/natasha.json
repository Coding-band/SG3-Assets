Quick, hold it down!\"<br /><br />There is anger in her brother's order and — she is sharp enough to tell — a hint of disappointment. Natasha hurries to hold onto the man's right arm, and musters all her strength to press down the cotton gauze onto his shoulder.<br /><br />The man lets out a heart-wrenching moan, but she can't stop until her brother orders her to.<br /><br />After who knows how long, the patient before her stops breathing, and she stares blankly at the lifeless body.<br /><br />\"You did your best,\" her brother says. His voice returning to its usual impassive tone. \"Get some rest real quick. Some of them are still waiting to be patched up.\"<br /><br />She turns over the man's red palm.

Then, she lowers her head and continues on reading the file she is holding.<br /><br />\"I see. That's exactly what your mother said... I wish you all the best then, Natasha.\"<br /><br />Natasha stands up and solemnly bows.

There's been lots of trouble in the Underworld, and the orphanage is overcrowded with the injured, so I haven't had time to do anything apart from treating the wounded. I even had to send some of the younger children to foster families in town, because I didn't want them to see the carnage inside the orphanage.<br /><br />As for your previous question — yes, I've heard rumors about the Supreme Guardian about to order a blockade between the Over- and Underworlds. I understand your concerns, but from my point of view, there is no way I can abandon the people down here right now. During this extraordinary state of panic, I can only hope to use my modest skills to bring a modicum of comfort to the needy.<br /><br />Fortunately, I know you'll respect my decision. I still remember when I was fresh out of college and Dad told me, \"Anyone going into medicine to just get a decent job will come to regret their decision sooner or later.\" I think I understand more than ever what you meant back then.<br /><br />I don't know when we'll ever be able to see each other again, but I hope you can be healthy and happy. Your daughter is a big girl now, and can take care of herself, so you don't have to worry about me.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Your daughter, with love, </align><br /><align=\"right\">Natasha</align>",

He is breathing heavily, his chest heaving violently — he is right at death's door.<br /><br />Natasha's eyes move quickly over to the patient, searching for anything fatal that could rob him of his life. She soon locates a wound on his lower left abdomen. Although it isn't large, the bleeding is constant and it's likely that his internal organs had been injured by some kind of sharp weapon.<br /><br />She put on a new pair of gloves and tears a large piece of bandage off the roll. She skillfully and tightly wraps it tightly around the patient's waist, pressing down on the area that is bleeding. A dark red spreads through the surface of the bandage, but Natasha maintains her pressure without betraying the slightest hint of panic.<br /><br />After a short while, the man's breathing is no longer rapid and the tense expression on his face eases. Natasha knows he is out of danger and has safely fallen asleep.<br /><br />She slowly takes off her gloves and leans against the clinic's window sill in a brief repose.<br /><br />\"Please don't die, Oleg...\"<br /><br />She whispers to herself as she gazes at the bed.<br /><br />\"...There're still a lot of duties we need to complete.\"",
