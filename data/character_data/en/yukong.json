Therefore, many of us are more passionate about enjoying the fun in life — chasing the best moments in life with all our heart and soul.<br /><br />Me? I am currently <nobr>246</nobr> years old. I am one step into my grave and have long gone past my days of merriment. You might know of my decisive and dashing ways when I was younger. In the tales of older Xianzhou natives, you might even hear of my achievement — such as running six consecutive red lights.<br /><br />I had just become an adult back then, and I was dragged in front of the general for the infringement... Guess what happened? The general wanted me to join the Sky-Faring Commission purely because of my piloting prowess, and he thought I was going to make it big in the Sky-Faring Commission.<br /><br />Back then, he used to call me the \"Delinquent Girl.\" Later on, they all called me \"Ace.\"",

I used to think the same way, that we will never grow old, that we will maintain the same appearance of youth.<br /><br />Every time we head out for a battle, I always promise my comrades, \"You just worry about holding onto your weapon. I'll bring you back to Xianzhou.\"<br /><br />But I broke my promise. After that fateful battle, only I returned to the Sky-Faring Commission, dragging my own damaged body.<br /><br />I can never return. I understood that then.<br /><br />From then on, I tunnel-visioned on official documents, abandoning any dream of returning to the sky.<br /><br />I grew old.",

The story tells of a young man who made a deal with a deity. He wished to be immortal, to be deathless. The deity granted his wish. He would never die, but his body would continuously weaken and wither eternally. He would carry the burden and sufferance of old age of perpetuity. This was all because he dared to dream about an unchanging flesh.<br /><br />At the end of the story, the old man who told me the story expressed the sentiments above. Perhaps, to Outworlders, the Xianzhou ships are dreamboats of bliss that traverse the ocean of stars, where people will spend their everlasting lifespan in enjoyment of sublime happiness, never knowing the pains of separation, aging, and death. In my opinion, that was not the case.<br /><br />Xianzhou natives are precisely experiencing an eternal deterioration. Sure, I am as energetic as I was when I was fifty years old. I can drive a starskiff through a valley no wider than two yards, I can dance continuously for hours, and I can sing... You may find this difficult to believe, but I can sing better than many of the performing artists in the Exalting Sanctum.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I will not do any of those things again. I do not want to do any of them, as they bring me no enjoyment. Not many things do. Not anymore.<br /><br />This is our deterioration. This is the deterioration of all Xianzhou natives.",

I sunk to the ground and gazed up helplessly.<br /><br />In my dream, that was the day I died.<br /><br />I think about it a lot. I think about the past. I have seen dead suns.
