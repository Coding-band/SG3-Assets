I have to save more...\"<br />She would awake from these dreams with her face covered in tears. But she knows that all her promises could only ever be fulfilled on the battlefield.<br /><br />She puts on her armor and walks to the very front of the formation. She allows the madness to seep into her blood and uses her bare hands to tear open a crimson path for her forces to advance.<br />She descends on the enemy like a meteor, and mountain-like beasts crumble to dust under the force of her attacks.<br />She single-handedly pushes the enemy armies to retreat before her soldiers' eyes.<br />\"The Merlin's Claw! The Merlin's Claw!\"<br />The weak call she heard before has completely transformed into a battle cry, as a great and primitive will wake with her infection.<br /><br />She stands still among the rain of blood and roars out in a berserk rage<br />\"I promise you all.<br />One day, I will be faster than the Reignbow's Lux Arrow.<br />One day, we shall no longer have to witness the falling of 'shooting stars.'\"<br /><br />On that day, in that rain, she is reborn and recast in blood and fire.",

You and I both know that the consequences of Moon Rage are becoming more frequent and pronounced. All I can do is try my best to slow it down.\"<br />\"So?\"<br />\"But it is all just a matter of time. I fear that, in the future, you will completely lose yourself, never to...\"<br />She smiles.<br />\"You are responsible for 'curing' me, and I am responsible for 'curing' war. We promised that we would both give our all to these roles.\"<br /><br />After receiving her medication, she deliberately takes a long route home across a quiet and secluded path. On the other side of the wall, she can hear the bustling and excited sounds of people in a packed market street. The calls of vendors and the laughter of children rise and fall.<br />\"What a wonderful time this is.\" She murmurs to herself.<br /><br />Suddenly, a Yellowbell Resonance System notification begins to ring in her ears:<br />\"We have secured a resounding victory against Toste-VIII abominations.\"<br />\"We have secured a resounding victory against Sakin Chadu abomination thanks to IPC's assistance after initial setbacks.\"<br />\"We have secured a resounding victory in the battle of Gordo.\"<br />\"...\"<br /><br />Before her life ends, she will hunt down every one of her nemeses.<br />Until the day that Moon Rage turns her into a truly feral beast that cannot tell friends from foe.<br />Until the day... when the arrow of The Hunt will pierce her own heart.",
