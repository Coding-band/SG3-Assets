You should report more on the suffering of everyday people and pay less attention to gossip about the Architects...\"<br /><br />\"I'm telling you, that blue-haired punk has slipped off into the Administrative District again! Yesterday he pinched three catties of rye bread spices from my store — three whole catties! Do you know how long those will last for the dignitaries? Next thing, he'll be robbing a spice factory!\"<br /><br />\"Please calm down, sir! We sympathize deeply with your plight.
